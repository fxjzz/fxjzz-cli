# FXJZZ-CLI [![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

## intro

This is a cli I created while learning frontend development, modeled after vue-cli to gain a better understanding of its workings.

## usage

### install

```
pnpm i -g @fxjzz-cli/core
```

### create a vite project

```
f create your-project
```

### commit to your RemoteRepo

To use this feature, you need to use your repository token.

```
f commit
f commit -c           //clear cache
f commit -p           //publish
```
